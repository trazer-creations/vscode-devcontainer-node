/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

Syntax: markdownlint-cli2 glob0 [glob1] [...] [globN] [--config file] [--fix]

Glob expressions (from the globby library):
- * matches any number of characters, but not /
- ? matches a single character, but not /
- ** matches any number of characters, including /
- {} allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions
- ! or # at the beginning of a pattern negate the match
- : at the beginning identifies a literal file path

Dot-only glob:
- The command "markdownlint-cli2 ." would lint every file in the current directory tree which is probably not intended
- Instead, it is mapped to "markdownlint-cli2 *.{md,markdown}" which lints all Markdown files in the current directory
- To lint every file in the current directory tree, the command "markdownlint-cli2 **" can be used instead

Optional parameters:
- --config  specifies the path to a configuration file to define the base configuration
- --fix     updates files to resolve fixable issues (can be overridden in configuration)

Configuration via:
- .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc
- .markdownlint-cli2.yaml
- .markdownlint-cli2.cjs or .markdownlint-cli2.mjs
- .markdownlint.jsonc or .markdownlint.json
- .markdownlint.yaml or .markdownlint.yml
- .markdownlint.cjs or .markdownlint.mjs
- package.json

Cross-platform compatibility:
- UNIX and Windows shells expand globs according to different rules; quoting arguments is recommended
- Some Windows shells don't handle single-quoted (') arguments well; double-quote (") is recommended
- Shells that expand globs do not support negated patterns (!node_modules); quoting is required here
- Some UNIX shells parse exclamation (!) in double-quotes; hashtag (#) is recommended in these cases
- The path separator is forward slash (/) on all platforms; backslash (\) is automatically converted

The most compatible syntax for cross-platform support:
$ markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules"/**
 *  The [Base58 Encoding](link-base58) scheme allows a **numeric** value
 *  to be encoded as a compact string using a radix of 58 using only
 *  alpha-numeric characters. Confusingly similar characters are omitted
 *  (i.e. ``"l0O"``).
 *
 *  Note that Base58 encodes a **numeric** value, not arbitrary bytes,
 *  since any zero-bytes on the left would get removed. To mitigate this
 *  issue most schemes that use Base58 choose specific high-order values
 *  to ensure non-zero prefixes.
